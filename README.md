## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- MySQL JDBC Driver (mysql-connector-java)

## Database Setup

### 1. Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE eems_db;
USE eems_db;
```

### 2. Run the SQL Script
Execute the provided `eems_database_schema.sql` file to:
- Create all tables with proper foreign keys
- Insert sample data

```bash
mysql -u root -p eems_db < eems_database_schema.sql
```

### 3. Update Database Connection
Edit `DatabaseConnection.java` to match your MySQL configuration:
```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/eems_db";
private static final String USER = "your_username";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";
```

## Project Structure

### Domain Entities
- **Department**: Organizational units with budget and location
- **Employee**: Workforce members assigned to departments
- **Project**: Operational tasks with budgets and timelines
- **Client**: External partners with contact information
- **EmployeeProject**: Many-to-many relationship tracking time allocation

### Core Features

#### CRUD Operations
All entities support full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with validation.

#### Business Logic Tasks

**Task 1: Calculate Project HR Cost**
```java
calculateProjectHRCost(int projectId)
```
Calculates total HR cost based on:
- Project duration (months)
- Employee salaries
- Time allocation percentages

**Task 2: Get Projects by Department**
```java
getProjectsByDepartment(int departmentId, String sortBy)
```
Retrieves active projects for a department, sorted by specified field.

**Task 3: Find Clients by Upcoming Deadline**
```java
findClientsByUpcomingProjectDeadline(int daysUntilDeadline)
```
Identifies clients with projects ending within specified days.

**Task 4: Transfer Employee**
```java
transferEmployeeToDepartment(int employeeId, int newDepartmentId)
```
Performs transactional employee department transfer with validation.

## Compilation

### Using Command Line
```bash
# Compile all Java files
javac -d bin -cp ".:mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" src/com/eems/**/*.java

# Run the test application
java -cp "bin:mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" com.eems.EEMSTestApplication
```

### Using Maven (Optional)
If you prefer Maven, create a `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>mysql</groupId>
        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        <version>8.0.33</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Running the Application

The `EEMSTestApplication.java` demonstrates all functionality:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Creates, reads, updates, and deletes records for all entities
2. **Business Logic Tasks**: Executes all 4 required business logic methods
3. **Error Handling**: Shows referential integrity enforcement
4. **Transactions**: Demonstrates transactional employee transfers

### Expected Output
```
======================================
EEMS - Employment Management System
======================================

========== DEPARTMENT CRUD TESTS ==========
=== All Departments ===
Department{departmentId=1, name='Software Engineering', ...}
...

========== TASK 1: CALCULATE PROJECT HR COST ==========
Project HR Cost for Project 1: $1234567.89
...
```

## Key Features Implemented

### N-Tier Architecture
- ✅ **Domain Model Layer**: Pure POJOs with business logic
- ✅ **Data Access Layer**: JDBC-based repositories
- ✅ **Business Logic Layer**: Validation and complex operations
- ✅ **Presentation Layer**: Controllers for each domain

### Database Design
- ✅ Primary keys on all tables
- ✅ Foreign keys with referential integrity
- ✅ Junction tables for M:M relationships
- ✅ Proper data types and constraints

### Relationships Implemented
- **Employee ↔ Department**: 1:M (Each employee in one department)
- **Employee ↔ Project**: M:M (via Employee_Project junction table)
- **Project ↔ Client**: M:M (via Project_Client junction table)
- **Project ↔ Department**: M:M (via Project_Department junction table)

### Validation & Error Handling
- Input validation in service layer
- Referential integrity checks before deletion
- Transaction rollback on failure
- Meaningful error messages

## Testing the Application

### Manual Testing
You can modify `EEMSTestApplication.java` to test specific scenarios:

```java
// Test creating a new employee
empController.createEmployee("Jane Doe", "Analyst", 
    LocalDate.of(2024, 1, 15), new BigDecimal("70000.00"), 2);

// Test calculating project cost
projController.calculateProjectHRCost(1);

// Test finding clients with upcoming deadlines
clientController.findClientsByUpcomingDeadline(30);
```

### Database Verification
You can verify results directly in MySQL:
```sql
-- Check all employees
SELECT * FROM Employee;

-- Check project assignments
SELECT e.full_name, p.name, ep.time_allocation_percent
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee_Project ep ON e.employee_id = ep.employee_id
JOIN Project p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id;

-- Check department budgets
SELECT name, annual_budget FROM Department;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Error**
```
Error: Could not connect to database
Solution: Check MySQL is running and credentials in DatabaseConnection.java
```

**ClassNotFoundException**
```
Error: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver not found
Solution: Add MySQL JDBC driver to classpath
```

**Foreign Key Constraint**
```
Error: Cannot delete department with existing employees
Solution: This is intentional - transfer employees first or delete them
```

## Project Deliverables Completed

### Design Phase
- ✅ Domain class definitions with justifications
- ✅ Complete database schema with all tables
- ✅ Sample data (5+ records per table)
- ✅ All required relationships (1:M, M:M)

### Implementation Phase
- ✅ N-Tier architecture strictly followed
- ✅ Pure JDBC (no ORM frameworks)
- ✅ Complete CRUD for all entities
- ✅ All 4 business logic tasks implemented
- ✅ Referential integrity enforcement
- ✅ Transaction management
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Test class demonstrating all features

## Code Quality

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **No Business Logic in DAL**: Repositories only handle persistence
- **Validation in Service Layer**: All business rules enforced
- **Clean Code**: Proper naming, documentation, and structure
- **DRY Principle**: Reusable code patterns
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with meaningful messages

## Extension Ideas

Want to extend this project? Consider:
1. Adding pagination for large result sets
2. Implementing search/filter functionality
3. Adding audit logging for all operations
4. Creating reports (e.g., department utilization)
5. Adding project budget vs. actual cost tracking
6. Implementing role-based access control

## Author Notes
